## About Me ##
I am a combined degree student studying Media Production, Management, and Technology for my undergraduate degree and Web Design for my graduate degree.
I love to read and I review books in my spare time.
I took a film class in high school that led me to UF's College of Journalism and Communications and the combined degree program that I'm a part of.
I chose this photo of a kitten reading because it reminds me of two of my favorite things: books and my own gray cat, Edwin, who is much larger than the pictured kitten.
## Past Coding Experience ##
I did a little bit of HTML coding as part of a Computing for Colleges and Careers class in 8th grade. Other than that, I haven't touched coding since.
## Career Goals ##
1. I want to be able to make a living doing creatively fulfilling work.
2. I want to be able to work remotely with flexible hours to accomodate my fluctuating health.
3. I want to continue working with technology in new ways.
4. I want a career where I am always pushing myself to keep learning.
